# QR_Code_Reader
 A QR code reader is a tool that scans and decodes QR codes, which are 2D barcodes containing information such as URLs, text, or other data. Using a camera or scanner, the reader captures the code and quickly interprets the embedded information, allowing users to access websites, download apps, or view content with ease.
